# Steps Done, to complete the Week 1st Assignment.

The following steps were done:

--> Understand clearly the webpage purpose and content
--> Semantic HTML
--> Web accesibility standards
--> Research sources to understand key concepts
--> How to edit Markdown files
--> What code refactoring is
--> Creating and proper use of a README.mb file


Structure and descriptive comments were added
Changed title to "Digital Marketing Tatics"


<==  Header  ==>

<==  Main content ==>

<==  Content on Right Side of Main content ==>

<==  Page footer ==>



I've changed <div>  to <nav> tag in HTML, and #header nav CSS rules

I've changed <div>  to <header> tag

I've included Hero Section into the header section.



I've added <main> tag to group the main content

I've added <footer> tag at the bottom of the page

I've changed Content as class to Id both in the HTML and CSS files

I've included alt properties with related description for each image


Modifications to the CSS file :


/* ===== Universal selector ====== */

/* ==== Removed predefined codes ===== */

/* ===== Content Style in Structure ====== */


/* ===== Header ====== */

/* ==== Content ===== */

/* ==== Left Side Content ==== */

/* ==== Footer ===== */

As well,
I've simplified the rules into one rule : 

.search-engine-optimization,
.online-reputation-management,
.social-media-marketing {
    margin-bottom: 20px;
    padding: 50px;
    height: 300px;
    font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;
    background-color: #0072bb;
    color: #ffffff;
}

.search-engine-optimization img,
.online-reputation-management img,
.social-media-marketing img {
    max-height: 200px;
}



.benefit-lead,
.benefit-brand,
.benefit-cost {
    margin-bottom: 32px;
    color: #ffffff;
}

.benefit-lead h3,
.benefit-brand h3,
.benefit-cost h3 {
    margin-bottom: 10px;
    text-align: center;
}

.benefit-lead img,
.benefit-brand img,
.benefit-cost img {
    display: block;
    margin: 10px auto;
    max-width: 150px;
}
